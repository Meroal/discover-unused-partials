== Description

This utility script (which someday will be a Rails plug-in) was made in order to 
help developers to find out unused partials.


== Usage

To use this script, simply run it in your RAILS_ROOT. It will return a list of 
unmentioned partials. It supports detection of Haml and Erb (both .erb and
.rhtml) templates.

=== Thanks
Special thanks goes to Willian Molinari (PotHix) and Mateus Linhares
(mateuslinhares) that helped me writing this little script.
